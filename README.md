# PROACTIVE-NATURAL-CALAMITIES-PREDICTION-AND-MITIGATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of natural calamities like earthquakes,
floods, cyclones, etc., that occur all over the globe, impacting populated
areas and threatening both lives and infrastructural damage. Due to their geographical
settings, Low-lying deltaic countries face the risk of calamities events, including
storms and ocean floods. So, accurate natural calamity prediction is crucial to mitigate
the devastating impact on lives, livelihoods, and economic growth. In addition,
accuracy prediction and error reduction are necessary to reduce damage. Several
tools and technologies, including mathematical analysis and machine learning algorithms
like decision trees and support vector machines, have been proposed to
address these natural calamities predictions. However, their effectiveness is limited
due to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of these natural calamities. Thus,
incorporating different deep learning and conventional methods into disaster prediction
and mitigation to improve accuracy and reduce mean absolute error (MAE) and
root mean square error (RMSE).

This project addresses the limitations of traditional natural disaster prediction by utilizing advanced deep learning, showing promising results in precise geographical and environmental analysis.
